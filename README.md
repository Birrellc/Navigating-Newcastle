# Navigating Newcastle 

---

## Description

_this is a fictitious website created for my milestone project 3 with the code institute_.

An online website on "Geordie" dialect which is a rather well known accent widely recognised for being very distinct with many jargon/slang terms used instead of "proper" english. This website will allow users to view "Geordie Slang" and also add their own also with definitions of what each term means incase people ever visit Newcastle.

### Landing Page

The landing page design I have chosen follows a modern approach which will follow throughout the website. This will consist of a simple image background with a diagonal clip path shape over the top of it on desktop view and for mobile and tablet a sideways pentagram shape for text to be place while having an image in the arena not covered. A welcome header will be displayed in the clip path displayed vertically with 2 call to action button to Signup/login. There will be 3 bar navigation button (hamburger menu) to allow users to open a navigation menu to explore the website or they could scroll down with smooth scrolling and also this allows
users to best experience the website and it's animation effects (taken from a youtube tutorial which will be credited further below and also in the code).

### Geordie Dictionary

Inside the main section will be cards displaying 'Geordie Dialect' words and phrases which can then be opened up when clicked to show definition and who added the word or phrase to the page.

### Contact

This page is a simple form with an image behind it. The form on this page will allow the user to contact the restaurant with any complaints, suggestions or questions they may have about the website.
