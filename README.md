# Navigating Newcastle

---

## Description

_this is a fictitious website created for my milestone project 3 with the code institute_.

An online website of the english city of Newcastle. This website will show a basic history of the northern city of england and also display information about the "Geordie" dialect which is a rather well known accent widely recognised for being very distinct with many jargon/slang terms used instead of "proper" english. This website will allow users to view "Geordie Slang" and also add their own also with definitions of what each term means incase people ever visit Newcastle.
